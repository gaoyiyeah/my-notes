Each SuperNode network on a chip (NoC) is implemented as a 4 by 2 mesh topology for a total of 8 CPU Clusters. Each cluster consist of a router, a directory control unit (DCU), 4 CPU cores and a shared cache. Attached to each SuperNode are two DDR4 memory controllers at opposite ends. With 4 cores per node and 8 nodes per SuperNode, there are a total of 32 cores per SN. Compliance to cache coherence is done by the core.

Routing is done via the router at every one of the clusters. The router has four communication channels: Response, Request, Snoop, and Acknowledgement. Each channel is 128-bit wide.
