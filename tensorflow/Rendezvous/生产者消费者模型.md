### 用途
实现跨设备通信

### 生产者消费者抽象
``` c++
// A Rendezvous is an abstraction for passing a Tensor
// from a producer to a consumer, where the consumer may safely
// request the Tensor before or after it has been produced.  A
// producer never blocks when using a Rendezvous.  A consumer has the
// choice of making a blocking call or providing a callback: in either
// case, the consumer receives the Tensor as soon as it is available.
```

Rendezvous 是实现 Tensor 从生产者到消费者传递的抽象类

---

### 特性
Nonblocking send, blocking receive 发送不阻塞，接收阻塞。


>A Rendezvous key encodes a single <producer, consumer> pair.  It is an error to call Send() or Recv*() more than once with the same key.
